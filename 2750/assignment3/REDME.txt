1.Problem

- Have to creat a library to that takes in a text file that contains the 
  inforation and parse it out.
- The parsed infromation should be stored in a union, and be able to access it back
- Now with given the same problem but now pasred it twice and by using JNI conver the main function from c to Java
- where java will call GUI function to show how it will look like  
- The GUI will hava  kind of compilers one for normal parameter manager and the other one is for Lex and yac
------------------------------------------------
2.Limation

- The Parsing is not perfect and it will give some error
  - When there is no list in the file there will be a saugment fault- it occurs beacause when plnext is called it returring infinit NULL
  - when the string is not provided it will preset to (NULL)
  - when the the int is not avaliable it will preset to 0
  - whe the bool is not set it will preset to no
  - when float is not provided it will preset to 0.0000
  - the program might seg fault when name is not provided
  
- I havent implneted the required check in the pmmanage
  - so if the number for required is 0 it wont anything 
- My arrya size is set ot 500, if thhe file is too bigger than that it will give 
  sagment fault

- The program will run most of the time,even though i have zero mem ory leak from my test case file 
  I am some how gettign JNI errors i try to solve them much as possible 

- When the compil or the compie - run pressed more than twice with same file it will case the program 
  parse error or JNI error 

- some times the program wont work it will cause pasrse error or JNI error 

- I try to fix most of the problem as possible but I couldn't find the JNI error  

- none of the compile config works

- my interface is not fully developed 

- I couldnt do the error checking 

- the program breaks and givs a JNI error when inputed a imporper file

- working directory seems to have some issues, not sure how ot compile and rum the files from different directory

- secound time parsing when using he IDE comipler only works wil some file, because of the hash function 

--------------------------------------------------
3.Run

- type make 
- inorder to run my program  type java Main it will open up the main GUI
  - to compile click on compile button 
  - to compile and run click on compile and run button 
  - in order to change the compile option  click on congif and choose change compilers
  - to close click on stop button or (ctrl - Q)
  - to save (ctrl s)
  - to save ass (ctrl shit s)
  - to open (ctrl O)
  - to help (F1)


------------------------------------------------------------
4. Testing 

- Tested out most of the cases 
   - if the file is all the identinfer and file info it will work perfectly
   - if the list is empty it will not print anything at the place
   - if there is sothing is new is in the text file it will provife you parse error 
   - there was a porblem that i fixed it when using the tab 
   - check to see if the JNIwrapper class working perfectly using soem test caes
   - check too see if the TA test cases are working 
   - run my program there is lot bugs thta i couldnt fix
   - saving without .config will give you an pop up to to save it as .config
